# FundStarter
FundStarter is a decentralized ecosystem for raising funds, supporting creators, and making donations to support needy people and non-profit organizations built on **Mantle Network**. We are trying to solve real-world problems using the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organisation.

## Core Objectives & Features -
* üîó Connect: We bridge the gap between the real world and the web3 world by enabling projects, creators, and non-profit organizations to get funds and support seamlessly. We enable people to create their own NFT DAOs. 
* üôè Support: We aim to support real-world projects by leveraging Blockchain at its core. FundStarter is providing a much better approach to solving crowdfunding and donation platform problems that exist in current web2 platforms.
* üíµ Reward: FundStarter provides a new way of raising funds. Everyone who funds, support, or donates via FundStarter will get a unique project-related NFT for their contribution that can be verified on-chain. Later, by holding NFTs, HODLers can earn yield whenever Creator or Project makes profits.
* üîî Update: With the help of EPNS and FundStarter DAO, users are notified whenever there is any update from the project, creators, or organizations after they got funding.
* üåç FundStarter DAO: DAO members will take all the essential decisions like accepting the listing proposal, distribution of funding, and distribution of profit for the smooth functioning of the platform.
* üéØGOAL: Our Ultimate Goal is to connect & support people using blockchain in such a way that they can leverage the technology and bring some positive changes in the world.

### Main features
* For Projects - Verified Projects by DAO will be listed on the platform to raise funds. NFTs will be distributed to every project funder. Later when the project earns profit, there will be a distribution of profit on basis of NFT type to all project funders.
* For Creators - Verified Creators can raise funds for their new work like releasing a new song, a short movie on Youtube, etc, and get initial support from their supporters through FundStarter. Later creator will share part of their profit or exclusive access to all of the supporters who bought Supporter NFT.
* For Donations - It is our initiative to support a non-profit organization in creating a real impact in the world by using the power of decentralization. Using FundStarter, you can support and help verified non-profit organizations. Every donator will get a unique NFT for their donation.
* Our Donation platform solves the issue of making donations in a secure and trustless way.
It provides an opportunity for donators to make donations by being completely anonymous but on the other hand they can prove to someone that they have donated to this organization by showing their NFTs and on-chain transactions.
* It solves the lots of issues that people are facing in making donations in the current web3 system like they can not verify that they have done a donation without revealing their identity to another person. But in FundStarter, they can hide their identity and still verify their donation on-chain.

* It has the potential to bring the next wave of users to the blockchain, making web3 stronger than ever.

## Problems We Are Solving
* FundStarter solves the major problems with Web2 platforms like Limited Accessibility due to restrictions by Governments; High fees by platforms which reduces the amount received by Project; A single entity that controls the whole platform leads to issues such as censorship and biased decisions.
* FundStarter provides a decentralized, trustless, and community-controlled way to support which is not possible with traditional platforms. Being decentralized, we can process payments quite fast using crypto, especially for cross-border transfers.
* FundStarter provides ownership to users on projects and creators‚Äô content that they have supported. It solves the issue of funding digital content creation which still poses difficulties to creators.
* Everyone can create NFT - Despite the rapid growth of the NFT space in recent years with many platforms springing up here and there, funding digital content creation still poses difficulties to creators. Many of these platforms lack the features that meet the requirements of creators, investors, buyers, and/or fans from minting to monetizing NFTs.

* FundStarter Donation platform solves the issue of making donations in a secure and trustless way. It provides an opportunity for donators to donate by being completely anonymous but on the other hand, they can prove to someone that they have donated to this organization by showing their NFTs and on-chain transaction.
## Roadmap

* FundStarter Web App where people can fund, support and donate by buying NFTs. Currently, we have 3 types of NFTs(Funder, Supporter, Donator) with 3 tiers namely Silver, Gold, and Platinum.

* Development of FundStarter DAO for selection of listing proposals on the platform.
* FundStarter Web App will have the support of Lens Protocol( users can have their on-chain profile)
* Integration of Push Protocol ( to send notifications to users), and other such features in the public beta version.

**2023 Q4**
* General availability of FundStarter Web App and we'll be using these Gitcoin grants to incentivize the devs for their contributions to improve this open source project.
* Development of Project-based DAOs within FundStarter DAO in which project funders will receive equal rights to take decisions.
